KAF is a very simple, little and light Asp framework.

The basic idea of the framework:

The basic idea is that you create model objects in the Model
directory, you create view pages in the View directory, and you link
them together with a controller objects in the controller directory.

In addtion, I write a few common class for the foundation of the
framework such as Db, Exception, Cache, Lang, View, Router, Session
and so on.
